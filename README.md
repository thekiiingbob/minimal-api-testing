# api testing example

Small itty bitty example of api testing. Uses just Jest and Axios.

## How do I...

### run it

clone down this sucker, and cd into it

```
npm install
npm run test
```

### make myself understand this

There's only a single test file, with 3 tests in it. First test is using axios directly. The second two abstract that out. It's up to you to decide which method suites your needs best. Remember, with great power comes great responsibitility\*.

\* Spell check did not say that was spelled wrong some how, so I left it.
